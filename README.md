# What was asked ?

We needed to re-create a webpage while following some [instructions](https://github.com/becodeorg/bxl-hopper-1-25/tree/master/The%20Field/5.leaving_the_field).

# What did we do ?
I used some [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/)'s documentation, to create a card list of my favorite games.


# What did we learn ?
For this exercise, I learned to use the bulma framework.
